However, for 'Above Expectations', the rubric requires 'appropriate data collected and presented to quantify and understand the problem'. While the problem is quantified by referencing MOH benchmarks, the actual pre-project performance data (e.g., specific monthly figures before intervention) is presented in the 'Goal' section, not the 'Background'. Additionally, the 'negative feedback from patients' is mentioned but not quantified with specific data from ePES surveys in this section, as correctly pointed out by the Skeptic. This prevents awarding 'Above Expectations'.",

While improving wait times implicitly aligns with hospital objectives, the document does not explicitly state how these specific targets contribute to broader NUH or Children's Emergency department strategic objectives beyond meeting MOH benchmarks.

However, for 'Above Expectations', the rubric requires that 'root causes and main delays/bottlenecks of the problem' be 'well identified'. The Fishbone diagram lists many potential causes, but the project lacks data-driven prioritization or quantification (e.g., Pareto analysis, time studies) to confirm which of these are the *main* delays or root causes.

The document explicitly states 'Rapid experimentation average of arrival to end of triage time = 6 mins' and 'Reduction of 60% !!' from an 'initial prototype', demonstrating a rapid experiment and clear insights gained.

Benefits are quantified (wait times, ePES scores), intangible results are captured through caregiver feedback, and clear charts are used to show improvement. The results are sustained for 18 months, meeting the duration requirement for 'Above Expectations'. However, the rubric for 'Meet Expectations' explicitly asks: 'Are dips explained?'. The 'ED Arrival to Consult Wait Time' chart (PDF Page 8) shows significant fluctuations and dips in performance post-implementation that are not explained in the text. As the Skeptic correctly points out, this lack of explanation for performance dips prevents the project from fully meeting all criteria for 'Meet Expectations' and, more critically, undermines the claim of truly *consistent* sustained results required for 'Above Expectations'. Given the strict grading rules, this prevents a score of 30, but the overwhelming evidence for other 'Meet Expectations' criteria warrants a score of 20.",
