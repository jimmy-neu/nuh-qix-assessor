  "project_title": "Increasing Clinically Appropriate Contrast-enhanced MRIs (CE MRI) in CKD 4 Patients",
  "department": "Department of Diagnostic Imaging",
  "category": "Process Excellence",
  "problem_statement": "There were limited safe contrast-enhanced imaging options for CKD 4 patients in NUH, leading to the historical avoidance of Contrast-enhanced MRIs (CE MRI) due to concerns about Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) with older-generation gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). This occurred despite updated guidelines from the American College of Radiology (ACR) in 2020 and 2024 stating that current-generation GBCAs used in NUH pose minimal risk of NSF for CKD 4 patients, making CE MRI a safer and more appropriate option.",
  "smart_goals": "To increase the proportion of clinically appropriate Contrast-enhanced MRIs (CE MRIs) in CKD 4 patients from a pre-intervention median of 6.7% to 30% within the next 6 months.",

  ],
  "key_results": "The proportion of clinically appropriate Contrast-enhanced MRIs (CE MRIs) in CKD 4 patients increased from a pre-intervention median of 6.7% to a post-intervention median of 24%. Benefits include increased patient satisfaction, reduced patient re-visits, increased clinician diagnostic confidence, reduced resource utilization (hospital beds, scan slots, outpatient clinic slots), and cost savings. Specific cost savings include $70.8 saved per patient per month from reaching diagnosis and reducing follow-up, and $100-$133.3 saved per patient per month by avoiding further investigation with alternative modalities (e.g., Outpatient MRI: $800, Percutaneous biopsy: $400, PET-CT: $1600, Repeat clinic visit: $50).",
  "follow_up_plan": "The plan includes the eventual inclusion of both CKD 4 and CKD 5 patients, with a goal to reconvene with the Nephrology department in 1H 2026 with data. The established workflow can also be introduced to AH and NTFGH diagnostic imaging departments in the future."
