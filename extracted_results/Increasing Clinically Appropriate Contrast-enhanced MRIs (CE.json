  "project_title": "Increasing Clinically Appropriate Contrast-enhanced MRIs (CE MRI) in CKD 4 Patients",
  "department": "Department of Diagnostic Imaging",
  "category": "Process Excellence",
  "problem_statement": "There are currently limited safe contrast-enhanced imaging options for CKD 4 patients in NUH. Historically, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE MRI) with gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) has been avoided due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) with older-generation GBCAs. Despite updated guidelines from 2020 and 2024 confirming minimal NSF risk with current-generation GBCAs, there is a low proportion of clinically appropriate CE MRIs performed in CKD 4 patients.",
  "smart_goals": "To increase the proportion of clinically appropriate Contrast-enhanced MRIs (CE MRIs) in CKD 4 patients from a pre-intervention median of 6.7% (rounded to 7%) to 30% in the next 6 months.",

  "key_results": "The proportion of clinically appropriate Contrast-enhanced MRIs in CKD 4 patients increased from a pre-intervention median of 6.7% to a post-intervention median of 24%. This resulted in increased patient satisfaction, reduced re-visits to the hospital, increased diagnostic confidence and clinical decision making for clinicians, and reduced resource utilization (hospital beds, scan slots, outpatient clinic slots). Cost savings include $70.8 saved per patient per month due to earlier diagnosis and reduced follow-up, and $100-$133.3 saved per patient per month by avoiding further investigation with alternative modalities.",
  "follow_up_plan": "The plan includes the eventual inclusion of both CKD 4 and CKD 5 patients, with a goal to reconvene with the Nephrology department in 1H 2026 with data. The established workflow can also be introduced to other diagnostic imaging departments (AH and NTFGH) in the future."
