  "department": "Children's Emergency",
  "category": "Process Excellence",
  "problem_statement": "In the NUH Children's Emergency, the Arrival to Consult time for a paediatric patient is lagging behind MOH's benchmark of 20min (50th percentile) and 60min for 95th percentile. The project focuses on reducing the time to triage for P2 walk-in patients (both Adult and Children) and improving the Triage to Consult process. Negative feedback from patients regarding service level and communications also highlighted a need to uplift service experience. The scope includes walk-in patients and the P2 Patient journey from Arrival to Consultation (including temperature screening, registration & triage, and managing service expectations during wait).",
  "smart_goals": "Tiered, progressive target for overall 'Arrival to Consult' timing: In 3 months from workshop, achieve 50th percentile: 30 min and 95th percentile: 100 min. In 1 year, achieve 50th percentile: 25 min and 95th percentile: 80 min.",

  "key_results": "All targets for Arrival to Consult time were met. The CE P2 Arrival-to-Consult time has significantly improved and been sustained for 18 months. The Children's Emergency overall ePES score has significantly improved, remaining stable in the 90s range and achieving the NUH Target, with unprecedented high scores >95% in 2024 and 2025. Caregiver feedback showed 90% found it an improvement and 100% were supportive. Time savings for arrival to end of triage time showed a 60% reduction, from a current state average of 15 mins (50th percentile) to a rapid experimentation average of 6 mins.",
  "follow_up_plan": "The follow-up plan includes Audit Checks for continuous improvement and data analysis, Presentations for regular updates and feedback channels, Communications for effective stakeholder engagement, and Staff encouragement of best practices. Specific actions include enhancing the wayfinding system with additional directional signages at P3 Triage waiting area and improving visitor navigation with easily recognisable symbols like starfish markers on the Emergency Department floor premises."
